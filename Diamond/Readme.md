this project is to establish a diamond topography for the upcoming contact friction simulation
# Scene
* the size of diamond is in um;  
* diamond topography is designed to re-establish micro topography of silicon on wafer surface;  
* Miller index of crystal surfaces should match the practical case in silicon surface;
# Code
By using "multi-diamonds" codes in this project,we need to consider the number of diamonds as input data    
* input number of diamonds
# Reslut
### achievement
by using following codes of Forming [One Diamond](https://github.com/FangLintao/Simulation/blob/master/Diamond/Forming%20OneTetrahdron%20with%20different%20Crystal%20Planes%20Group.py) and [multi-diamond](https://github.com/FangLintao/Simulation/blob/master/Diamond/Overlap-Forming%20Several%20Tetrahdrons%20with%20different%20Crystal%20Planes%20Group.py), you should achieve this effect
